This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project Description

This Coursework Management System is designed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to provide a streamlined approach to managing coursework files. The system includes a file upload feature with drag-and-drop functionality for PDF files, as well as a manual upload option. It enforces a file size limit of 25 MB and utilizes browser local storage to store uploaded files, ensuring persistence across page reloads.

In addition to file management, the system features a Coursework Details Form where users can select the type of coursework and subject from dropdown menus, and input the essay title. This form data, along with the associated files, is also stored locally. Users can view a list of previously uploaded coursework, which is retrieved from local storage, enabling easy access and management of their submissions.
